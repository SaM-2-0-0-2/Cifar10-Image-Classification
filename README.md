# Cifar10-Image-Classification
In this project, Convolution neural network model was developed to classify the images with the help of Cifar10 image dataset. 
Tensorflow and Keras libraries of Python were used for development of CNN model.
Matplotlib is used to plot the performance of the model.
Rectified Linear Unit is activation function used for activating Neurons of CNN.
